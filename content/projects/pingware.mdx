<div id="introduction">
  I decided to build something like this, because I always dreamed about a network diagnostic tool that I can use on my phone. I wanted to be able to ping a server, check the status of a website, and check the status of a service. I also wanted to be able to do all of this from my phone, without having to open a terminal or a browser.

Pingware completely solves this problem. It's a multi-purpose network diagnostic tool/app that you can use on your phone. It's built with Flutter, and it's hosted on Google Cloud Run. It's also open source, so you can contribute to it, or even host it yourself.

It also did cross 500+ downloads on the Play Store, which is a huge milestone for me. I'm really happy with the progress that I've made with this project, and I'm looking forward to adding more features to it.
