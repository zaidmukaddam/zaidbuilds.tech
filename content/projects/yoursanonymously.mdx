<div id="introduction">

The idea of having a platform where anyone can send and receive anonymous messages has been around for a while. I've seen a few implementations of this idea, but I wanted to build my own. I wanted to build a platform that was simple, fast, and secure. I also wanted to build a platform that was easy to use and didn't require any sign up or login.

Yoursanonymously come out to a very simple solution for people who wanted to send confessions or messages to someone anonymously. The platform is very simple and easy to use.

## Tech stack

Well the tech stack is what makes this project so special. I've used a lot of new technologies in this project such as Next.js, TypeScript, Turbo, GraphQL, HeadlessUI, Prisma, and Planetscale.

The database used in yoursanonymously is a MySQL database provided by <a href="https://planetscale.com">Planetscale</a>. Planetscale is a database-as-a-service that provides a MySQL database with a free tier. The free tier is perfect for this project because it allows me to store up to 10GB of data for free. The database is hosted on Google Cloud Platform and is replicated across multiple regions. The database is also encrypted at rest and in transit.
